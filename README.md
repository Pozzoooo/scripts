scripts
=======

This scripts have been created with the intetion to help on a day-to-day job of an Android developer.
At the moment there is no big target for this repository, just a place where I dump quick (and some times dirty) solutions from day-to-day strugles, most of them are going to be related to Android stuff, but at times we are going to have general bash help.

In the days that memory doesn't help, here are the commands saved in a more personal way to save the day.
Feel free to sugest any changes, they are very welcome.
