WebView <-> WebView
	- Cookies are shared
	- An SSO system should be loggedin between webviews

WebView <-> Browser
	- Does not share cookies
	- Isolated SSO login

CustomTab <-> Browser
	- CustomTab acts like a browser, though it can be visualy customised
	- Cookies are shared
	- SSO should be loggedin between them

SSO
	WebView
	- Sharing cookies between webview and browser is not an option;
	- If SSO page is not under our control:
		- - He is necessarily going to need to login at least once;
	- If SSO page is under our control:
		- - We could find a solution with parameters, cookies or something similar to skip login again;
		- - He still need to login once in the webview;
	- When opening a client web site:
		- - We are not gonna be able to provide any information to the SSO login page, there is no standard here; 

	CustomTab
	- Shared with browser;
	- If user is logged in the browser:
		- - User is going to skip login inside CustomTab (might see permision page only);
		- - We can't recognize, so we can't suggest user to use CustomTab;
		- - We can open website (via CustomTab or Browser) and authentication should be automatically skiped;
	- If user is not logged in the browser:
		- - User will be requested for its credentials and then the all options from before are valid;
	- When opening a client web site:
		- - We need an auto-redirect that goes throught login page;
			- - - Something similar on what google does when you try to open gmail.com without being loggedin (after login success you proceed to the requested page);
